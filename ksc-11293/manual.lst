                                  INTRODUCTION

        Thå  IBM-Personaì  Computeò  haó  thå  abilitù  tï  perforí  manù
        operations as a 'stand alone' processor.   Its  features  include
        dual  floppy  disk  drives  and  a   communications   capability.
        These features, along with some software,  give  the  IBM-PC  the
        added ability to perform as a "host processor"  user's  terminal.
        In this case, the Owl-1200.

        The Owl-1200 is a simple user terminal with some intelligent cap-
        abilities.  These  capabilities  include  screen  formatting  and 
        block transmission of data.  This unit was chosen since it is one
        of the terminals used to run  Systonetics'  VIS1ON  software  for 
        hierarchical scheduling.

        2.1  GETTING STARTED

        The Owl-1200 emulation software is called OWL1200.  In  order  to
        enable OWL1200, slide the Owl1200 floppy diskette into  the  left
        disk drive slot and push the drive door closed (door must  become
        flush with the drive's front surface).  Now apply  power  to  the 
        monitor and IBM-PC.  The power switch for the IBM-PC is  the  red
        toggle switch on the right side of the IBM-PC box, near the back.

        After approximately 25 seconds,  the  system  will  ask  for  the 
        current date with the prompt:
                         Current date is DDD  MM-DD-YY
                         Enter new date: _

        Then the system will ask for the current time with the prompt:
                         Current time is  HH:MM:SS.SS
                         Enter new time: _

        Once the time and date are entered, the system is  ready  to  run 
        OWl1200.  When the system prompt ( 'A>' ) appears on the  screen, 
        enter:
                         A>OWL1200

        After the program has been loaded, the screen will clear and  the 
        IBM-PC will operate as if it were an OWL-1200.

        2.2  OPERATIONS

        Physically, the OWL-1200 is not nearly  similar  to  the  IBM-PC.  
        Therefore, some concessions have been made to allow the  user  to 
        invoke all of the capabilities of  an  OWL-1200  through  a  dual 
        screen facility.

        The terminal mode is  the  same  as  the  normal  screen  of  the 
        OWL-1200.  The characters may be manipulated just as  if  an  OWL 
        were being used.  The  command  mode  is  used  to  simulate  the 
        presence of the switches on the keyboard of the OWL-1200.

        The user may go to command  mode  at  any  time  while  the  host 
        processoò ió idle®   Wheî  thå  useò  enteró  commanä  mode¬  all  
        characters on the CRT screen and the cursor  position  are  saved 
        and rebuilt upon return to terminal mode.



        2.21  TERMINAL MODE

              When OWL1200 is initialized, it is in  terminal  mode.  
              This is when all functions  and  capabilities  of  the 
              OWL-1200 are enabled.  The IBM-PC may now be  operated 
              as if it were an OWL-1200.

              The command set for OWL1200 is identical  to  that  of 
              the OWL-1200, with the  exception  of  the  OWL-1200's 
              MULTICODE key.  OWL1200 uses the escape (Esc)  key  as 
              the MULTICODE key.

              Function keys-

              The OWL-1200 has  16  special  function  keys  on  its 
              keyboard.  They can be used with the SHIFT key to give 
              a total of 32 separate functions.  The IBM-PC has only 
              10 function keys.  These may be  used  in  conjunction 
              with the SHIFT, CONTROL and ALTERNATE keys foò á totaì 
              oæ 4° possiblå speciaì  functions®   Therefore¬  TABLE
              2.1 shows  the  relationship  between  the  OWL-1200's 
              function keys and the IBM-PC's function keys.

              may change some switch settings that  normally  reside 
              on the keyboard of the OWL-1200.  Since there  are  no 
              corresponding switches on the IBM-PC,  the  screen  is 
              used.  In  order  to  enter  command  mode,  hold  the 
              control key (Ctrl) down, then hit  'F' (CTRL-F).   The 
              screen shown in FIGURE 2.1 will appear:
